# Learning R
### A repository of R script files where I try becoming a better R programmer with open source books on R

This README file is to be updated with new material as and when I complete R related programming tasks that fit this category.

- ***advanced_r_programming_jhu*** contains material from the [Coursera course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/advanced-r) on Advanced R Programming offered by Johns Hopkins University (JHU). This folder contains:
  - `r-debugging` contains a script that explores debugging in R.
  - `r-functional_programming` contains a script exploring basics of R's functional programming capabilities.
  - `r-oop` focuses on object oriented programming capabilities of the R programming language (S3, S4, Reference Classes)
  - `r-profiling` focuses on using microbenchmark and other tools for profiling R code performance.
- `adv-r` contains whatever progress I made on Hadley Wickham's Advanced R programming [book](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/)
